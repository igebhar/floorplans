1.While doing this project the main problem I encountered was creating the sharpen
function. At one point the image was slanted and had multiple puppies being 
displayed. This proved to be a challenging task but all was defeatable. Another 
thing that was hard was figuring out how we were going to share files with 
ont another. 

2.To solve the problem about sharing files we used Git 
Hub which proved to be very resoursfuland will definitly be somethign 
I use in the future. To solve the issue with the slanted image we realized
that we were changing our vector into a 2D vector in apply_kernel 
but then when we were in sharben we were tryin to treat it as a 1D vector. 
We really had to look at our code but were able tp figure out the issue.

3. I found this project to be very interesting.  I especially liked it becuase 
it was easy to explain to friends and family what I was doing for my project.
I thought some of the concepts were vey difficult to understand. Such as not 
using the last rows and columns. Thinking my way around this problem required
assistance from the TA's but the tas was accomplishable once this was figured out
